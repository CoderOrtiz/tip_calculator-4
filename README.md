# Tip Calculator 4

Utilizing For Loops with Arrays

## Description:

Welcome back to the Tip Calculator Coding Challenge, this time we utilized JavaScript For Loops with Arrays. The original challenge requested I take ten predetermined values, calculate the Tip and Grand total, storing said values within an Array, and then logging them to the console. Within the console would state what the bill, tip and total amount was. You can view my solution to the original challenge under my commits titled, "Solution created to coding challenge".

Of course, though I decided we should do more, and is why I let you, the user, enter how many checks your party needs calculated! None of the above information would be displayed on the webpage, and I wanted more, so when you click on calculate, the user is provided the question, "How many checks are there?" You the user will enter how many checks you wish to enter, letâ€™s say three. You will be asked what bill came out to and once you enter it, you will be provided what check you are on, the bill amount, tip amount, and grand total. This will repeat until all three checks have been calculated.
 
## What I Learned:

1. In this challenge we learned about the For Loop and While Loops. I learned For Loops are ideal for problems that need to repeat. A While Loop is very similar to a For Loop, but unlike a For Loop, a While Loop does not need a counter to run. While Loops are ideal for problems that need to repeat while a condition is true. 

2. Furthermore, I also learned how to make Looping Arrays, Breaking Loops when a Statement becomes true, and Continuing Loops to only show what is desired by the programmer.

3. Lastly, I learned how to Loop backwards and how to write a Loop within a Loop! The original request of this coding challenge only needed one For Loop as there were already set values within the Bills Array. Because I wanted to expand this coding challenge, I intergraded a For Loop within a For Loop which I found very exciting and rewarding!

## What I Added:

 I added a button to this challenge titled, "Calculate...", this button calls the Function calcValues. Once calcValues is called, the user is provided a prompt asking how many checks there are. The next question, what is the check amount, will be repeated x number of times. The check amount gets entered as a string and is then converted into a number to be calculated within an Arrow Function. The output of the Arrow Function will be the Tip amount which will then be added to the Bill amount to develop the grand Total. The Bill, Tip, and Total amounts are each logged into their respective Arrays. An alert will pop up and advise the user what Check they are on, the Bill amount, the Tip amount, and lastly the grand Total.
